	<p id="header">Lions with CSS</p>
	<p id="content">The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a
		short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears. Its fur varies in
		colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red and dark brown.
		The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion
		has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although
		faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. The
		lion is the only member of the cat family that displays obvious sexual
		dimorphism. Males have broader heads and a prominent mane that grows
		downwards and backwards covering most of the head, neck, shoulders,
		and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust
		and black hairs.</p>
